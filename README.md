## Introduction

The `texti` file format is a text-based system for organizing information into sections with foldable elements. It’s designed to be used with text editors like Sublime Text, which support text folding to help manage large amounts of information.

## File Structure

A `.txti` file is organized into **sections**, which are delineated by headers and dividers. Each section can contain text, lists, and various types of content. Here’s a basic overview of the file structure:

```plaintext
=== === === === === === === SECTION TITLE === === === === === === === === === ===
    Content goes here
=== === === === === === === /SECTION TITLE === === === === === === === === === ===
```

- **Section Header:** `=== === === === === === === SECTION TITLE === === === === === === === === === ===`
- **Section Divider:** `=== === === === === === === /SECTION TITLE === === === === === === === === === ===`

## Sections and Keywords

### Static Pad

A **Static Pad** section is used for fixed information that you might refer to frequently, such as schedules or contact lists.

**Example:**

```plaintext
=== === === === === === === STATIC PAD  === === === === === === === === === ===
    => Project Deadlines
        1) Initial Proposal: 8/10
        2) Mid-Project Review: 9/15
        3) Final Submission: 11/30

    => Meeting Notes
        --> 2024-07-10: Kickoff Meeting
            - Discuss project goals and deliverables
        --> 2024-08-05: Status Update
            - Review progress and address issues
        --> 2024-09-12: Team Check-In
            - Ensure alignment with project timeline
=== === === === === === === /STATIC PAD === === === === === === === === === ===
```

### Notes

The **Notes** section is for miscellaneous information, ideas, or reflections. It can include text, markdown, or any other simple format.

**Example:**

```plaintext
=== === === === === === ===  NOTES  === === === === === === === === === === ===
    ------------------------ About Markdown --------------------------
        Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.
        It's widely used for documentation and note-taking.

    -------------------- texti Features ---------------------

        integrate simple text-based interfaces.
=== === === === === === === /NOTES  === === === === === === === === === === ===
```

### Storage

The **Storage** section is used for storing detailed information like documents or structured data.

**Example:**

```plaintext
=== === === === === === ===  STORAGE    === === === === === === === === === ===
    ========================= TO-DO LIST =========================================
        -------------------- Work Tasks -----------------

=== === === === === === === /STORAGE    === === === === === === === === === ===
```

### Journal

**Example:**

```plaintext
=== === === === === === ===  JOURNAL    === === === === === === === === === ===
    ------------------------Friday, July 5th 2024----------------------------
        Today:

        I will also take some time to organize my study materials.

## Using texti Files

1. **Creating a `.txti` File:** Start with a blank text file and save it with the `.txti` extension.
2. **Organizing Information:** Use sections to categorize your information. Create headers and dividers as needed.
3. **Folding Sections:** In Sublime Text, you can use the text folding feature to collapse and expand sections.

## Advanced Features

### Adding Interfaces

You can embed simple text-based interfaces using special keywords:

- `[clock]` – Displays the current time.
- `[calendar]` – Displays a calendar for the current month.
- `[weather]` – Displays the current weather conditions.

**Example:**

```plaintext
[clock]
[calendar]
[weather]
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Sections Clear:** Ensure that each section has a clear purpose and label.
- **Use Descriptive Headers:** Choose section titles that clearly describe the content.
- **Update Regularly:** Regularly update your `.txti` file to keep information current.
